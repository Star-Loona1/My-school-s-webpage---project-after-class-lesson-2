        <h2><strong><mark>WHAT is EVERYDAY MATH?</mark></strong></h2>

        <p><strong><mark>INTRODUCTION - What it's all about?</mark></strong><br>
<br>
            Everyday Mathematics is a comprehensive math curriculum for students in grades <em><b>pre-K through 6</b></em>. It emphasizes <i><b><mark>real-world
            problem-solving, balanced instruction, and multiple opportunities for basic skills practice</mark></b></i>. The program, developed by
            the <strong>University of Chicago School Mathematics Project</strong>, aims to build <b>students' mathematical understanding and skills
            through practical applications and engaging activities</b>.
        </p><br>

        <p><strong><mark>MORE DETAILED ABOUT EVERYDAY MATH</mark></strong><br>
           <b>1. Real-world problem-solving</b><br>
           Everyday Mathematics connects mathematical concepts to everyday situations, making learning more relevant and relatable for
        students.<br>
<br>
        <b>2. Balanced Instruction</b><br>
        The program incorporates whole-class instruction, small-group activities, partner work, and individual tasks to cater to
        different learning styles and promote both teacher-directed learning and student exploration.<br>
<br>
        <b>3. Multiple Practice Opportunities</b><br>
        Students get ample chances to practice basic math skills through fact practice, fluency activities, mental math
        exercises, review problems, and math games.,<br>
<br>
        <b>4. Communication emphasizes</b><br>
        Students are encouraged to explain their mathematical thinking and engage in discussions to foster deeper understanding.<br>
        <br>

        <b>5. Home/School Partnerships</b><br>
        Everyday Mathematics encourages collaboration between teachers and parents to support student learning at home.<br>
        <br>

        <b>6. Spiral Curriculum</b><br>
        The curriculum introduces concepts early and revisits them throughout the grades, reinforcing learning and building upon
        prior knowledge.<br>
        <br>

        </p>

        <p><strong><MARK>Curriculum Structure</MARK></strong><br>
            <br>
            <b>1. Content Areas</b><br>
            The curriculum covers six key mathematical content areas: numeration and order, measures and measurement, reference
            frames, operations, patterns, functions, and sequences.<br>
            <br>

            <b>2. Process skills</b><br>
            It also focuses on developing five mathematical process skills: problem solving, reasoning and proof, communication,
            connections, and representation.<br>
            <br>

            <b>3. Digital and Print Formats</b><br>
            Everyday Mathematics 4Â® can be implemented in fully digital, fully print, or hybrid formats to suit different classroom
            needs.<br>
            <br>
